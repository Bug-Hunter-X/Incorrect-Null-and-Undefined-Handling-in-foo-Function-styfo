# JavaScript Bug: Incorrect Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrectly handling `null` and `undefined` values.  The `foo` function in `bug.js` attempts to add two numbers, but fails to properly account for scenarios where either input is `null` or `undefined`. The improved version in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by checking for `null` and `undefined` explicitly and handling them according to desired behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's root directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the incorrect output.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function in `bug.js` assumes that `null` and `undefined` should always be treated as 0.  This may not be the intended behavior in all situations.   The `foo` function should explicitly check for both values and provide appropriate handling depending on the use case.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects this issue by adding explicit checks for `null` and `undefined`.  These checks allow for more controlled behavior, potentially throwing errors or returning specific values based on the needs of the application.
